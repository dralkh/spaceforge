## Core Concepts

### Scheduling Algorithms: Optimize Your Learning
*   **FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler):** A cutting-edge, modern algorithm rooted in memory science that dynamically optimizes your review intervals for maximum retention and learning efficiency. Customize FSRS parameters in settings to fine-tune your spaced repetition system.
*   **SM-2 (SuperMemo 2):** A proven, classic spaced repetition algorithm. Spaceforge utilizes an enhanced version of SM-2 to intelligently manage overdue items and facilitate comprehensive note reviews, ensuring effective knowledge recall.

### AI-Powered MCQ Generation: Create Quizzes from Your Notes
Spaceforge seamlessly integrates with various AI services to automatically generate Multiple Choice Questions from your note content. This powerful feature transforms your study material into interactive quizzes, providing an alternative and effective way to test your understanding and reinforce learning. Ensure your chosen AI provider is configured correctly in the settings to unlock this intelligent quiz creation capability.
